        I am a passionate coder who believes that writing clean code is like
        brewing a perfect cup of coffee, it takes time, care, and just the right
        amount of skill. By day, Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer, crafting seamless
        user interfaces with React and making sure things just work. By night, I
        dive into C++, JavaScript, and Python, because, you know, a real coder
        never sleeps.
